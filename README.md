# Project-4_Group-8_Housing-Market-Analysis-Machine-Learning

**Overview:**

Given the recent ballooning in the real state pricing over the recent years it is becoming more difficult for first-home buyers to land themselves a dream home. Rising costs of living due to inflation, further exacerbates the matter in question. This projects then, is aimed toward those prospective buyers who are seeking a humble abode. Through visual analytics and machine learning, a model that is trained through historical data can be conceived to provide appraisal of value for various real estate property at will. With this on hand, potential buyers are with the knowledge and insight, to prepare for the next auction. Buyers would be having the confidence that the property they are after, best reflects the prices implied through the model. Some of the goals laid out within the analysis as are follows:
 

**Goals:**

1.	Identify the Relationships Between Estate Pricing and Other Underlying Key Factors: The first phase is to highlight all of the key factors that attributes to the selling prices of various housing properties. Land size and distance are some of the more common reasons that readily pops into mind but this analysis may hope to bring other facets to light.  

2.	Construction and Training of the Model That Would Be Used To Evaluate Property Prices: Implement the most appropriate machine learning algorithm to allow the model to achieve high accuracy potential with the data on hand. This model could then be implemented to classify and make trained estimated on house prices.

3.	Evaluate Predictive Power of Past Historical Data: While predicting housing market prices with high degree certainty is challenging, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of using existing data as a tool for early detection of market prices. By creating a model to determine housing prices based off specific criteria, we seek to assess the predictive capabilities of this analytical approach.

By addressing these 3 key goals we have set for ourselves, we seek to supply valuable insights into predicting the prices the Melbourne Property Market, ensuring that buyers can garner a comprehensive understanding. Hopefully such buyers will use this information to locate the home that best suits their needs with the right amount of money.
